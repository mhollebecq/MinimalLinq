# MinimalLinq
This repository contains minimal code to create a Linq provider

This code is taken from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/bb546158(v=vs.140)?redirectedfrom=MSDN that is no longer updated. You can not use it by itself, you will need to find how to implement `QueryProvider`.
